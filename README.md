# factoryFunction
Created with CodeSandbox

Skills practiced: actory function, object literals, add objects, array, for...of loop, for...in loop, add objects, empty array, for...of loop, if statement, push(), innerHTML, createElement, append()

I used a factory function to create a vehicle object. I added three objects and then looped over the objects! 

I designated two vehicle objects that need repair. I created an event that will display the vehicles that need repairing when a button is clicked.
